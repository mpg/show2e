Presentation
------------

This very small package aims at making debugging (esp. in an interactive way)
easier, by providing \show variants suited to \LaTeXe's commands (with
optional arguments or robust) and environments: those variants also display
the internal macros used by such commands, if any.  The \showcs variant helps
with macros with exotic names.
